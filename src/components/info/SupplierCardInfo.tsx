        Understanding preferred suppliers and their capabilities is critical to
        getting parts fit for purpose on time and at the right quality. This
        card shows suppliers who the company have used before, what they supply
        and an internal rating based on cost, quality and ease to work with.

        This area needs expanding further to create individual pages for each
        supplier to display more information. When working on live projects and
        engineering releases, each release will reference a supplier, allowing a
        feedback loop for others who may be considering using the same supplier.
